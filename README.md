# DP-3

## Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/)
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.

 

Note:

1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100
