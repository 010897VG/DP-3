# DP-3

## Problem1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]

Output: 6

    Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
    Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

Output: 9

    Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
    Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.9 total points are earned.

Note: The length of nums is at most 20000.
      Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].

## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/)
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.

 

Note:

1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100
